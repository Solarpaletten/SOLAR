git commit -m "🏢 WIP: Company Management v1.7.0 - Initial Setup

✨ Features in Progress:
- AccountDashboardPage updated with company creation modal
- Fixed component structure and state management  
- Added CreateCompanyData interface and form
- Updated imports to use services/company/companyService path

🔧 Technical Changes:
- Fixed state variables inside React component
- Added handleCreateCompany function with proper error handling
- Implemented company selection with companyService.selectCompany()

⚠️ Known Issues (To Fix):
- Backend /api/account/companies endpoint returns 404

🎯 Next Steps:
- Implement backend /api/account/companies endpoints
- Add /api/company/clients endpoints with multi-tenant filtering
- Create ClientsPage component for client management
- Test company creation and client isolation
- Deploy and tag v1.7.0 release

📋 Branch Purpose:
This branch implements complete company management system:
- Company creation, selection, and switching
- Multi-tenant client management with data isolation

- Production-ready company dashboard with client integration

Ready for backend implementation and frontend-backend integration testing."
